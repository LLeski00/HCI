            <p>
                Choosing the right ski resort depends on your skill level,
                budget, and preferred location. Beginners should look for
                resorts with gentle slopes and good instruction programs.
                Advanced skiers may prefer resorts with challenging terrain and
                off-piste options. Consider proximity, accommodation options,
                and overall cost when making your decision.
