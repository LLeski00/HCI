            <h2>How to choose a resort</h2>
            <p>
                Choosing the right ski resort depends on your skill level,

                resorts with gentle slopes and good instruction programs.
                Advanced skiers may prefer resorts with challenging terrain and
                off-piste options. Consider proximity, accommodation options,
                and overall cost when making your decision.
